Hi,

I'm Prashanth Chengi, grandson of C.L. Subba Rao, eldest son of Chenji Lakshman Rao. I'm making an attempt to create a family tree, starting from Chenji Lakshman Rao.
Chenji Lakshmana Rao and his wife Nagu Bai, had seven sons; Subba Rao, Anantha Rao, Ramachandra Rao, Vasudeva Rao, Purushotthama Rao, Gopinath Rao, and Narayana Rao.
I'm trying to gather information about all their descendants. If you are a descendent, please reach out to me on Facebook, or twitter (@pchengi). Please feel free to pass this message onto your/our relatives.
